# vampire
Web-based helper app for the solo RPG Thousand Year Old Vampire

Initial version is command-line only, and requires separate resource tracking. Currently, it only scans for a text file under the assets directory (not included in the project itself).

Next version will guide you through the prompts, using https://github.com/devinherron/dice
Character creation and tracking won't be part of this version, and will need to be tracked by the player
